I write orthogonal and simple software with Go, C and Odin. Mostly open source.
APIs, pipelines, real-time services, embedded systems and graphics.
But also cross-platform and Linux utilities.
For end-user apps I use JavaScript/TypeScript (HTMX, Astro, Solid).
I am currently learning the ARM embedded programming and raw game development.
